      When a group of young people from 11 countries, from 3 continents, will
      spend two years of their time on a joint project, it is inevitable that

      indicators for success, enabling youth organizations to evaluate their
      communities, cities in order to better understand social entrepreneurial
      eco-systems, to better identify the area of focus and potential
      partners. We developed the manual in support of the Methodology (NAME)
